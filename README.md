# NotesTaker
wpf application to take notes

this note taker is kind of a mixture of sticky notes and snipping tool.

first of all, create a word file for your notes
then from the application select that file
then you can proceed to enter your running notes etc quickly in the text box
or if you're taking notes from online tutorial, you can use the snip option to capture
everything gets stored in the word file; you can edit and format it later when you have lots of time :)


if you're a dummy, download that zip file, extract it, and launch notetakerv1

if you know something about .net, then go on read my code and customize it as required, 
i've tried to keep it clean.
