# NotesTaker
wpf application to take notes

This note taker is kind of a mixture of sticky notes and snipping tool.

First of all, create a word file for your notes;
then from the application select that file;
then you can proceed to enter your running notes etc quickly in the text box;
or if you're taking notes from online tutorial, you can use the snip option to capture screen;
everything gets stored in the word file; you can edit and format it later when you have lots of time :)


if you're a dummy, download that zip file, extract it, and launch notetakerv1

if you know something about c#, then go on read my code and customize it as required, 
i've tried to keep it clean.
